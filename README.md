# Employee Directory
## A react based Employee Directory

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context 

* An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Development goal

Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render.
The user should be able to:

* Sort the table by at least one category

* Filter the users by at least one property.

## Table of Contents

* The Build folder and the node_modules contain the files and packages that were created by the React app. These file and folders were not developed any further.
* The public folder was created by the react app as well but I have added the assets/images folder to store the screenshot of the app. https://github.com/BeresIvan/Employee-Directory/tree/main/public/assets/images

* Inside the src folder you can find all the developed sub folders 
   - the components folder https://github.com/BeresIvan/Employee-Directory/tree/main/src/components
   - the styles folder https://github.com/BeresIvan/Employee-Directory/tree/main/src/styles
   - and the utils folder with the API subfolders https://github.com/BeresIvan/Employee-Directory/tree/main/src/utils

* The package.json file was modified to enable the deployment of gitHub pages https://github.com/BeresIvan/Employee-Directory/blob/main/package.json

## Current Status 

* The app was tested localy react is very useful at ponting at errors and problems in the code.
* The app is deployed on gitHUB pages
